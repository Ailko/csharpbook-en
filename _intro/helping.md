# Want to help?

Nice to see you show interest in helping with this book. This can be done in multiple ways:

* You can always just mail me tips, remarks or corrections.
* You can download and edit the source files to your heart's content over [here](https://github.com/Ailko/csharpbook-en). Feel free to send me the changes afterwards.
* You can directly make changes through a fork on github and integrate it into the book with a merge request. Look below for an explanation.

# Want to help through a fork and merge request?

1. Make a github account
2. [Fork the book to your own account](https://github.com/Ailko/csharpbook-en) : click on fork in the upper left. And follow the explanation [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to stay in sync and make a local copy.
3. Make sure that you always work in the most recent version, as explained [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork).
4. Edit away
5. Every time you want to send me a batch of edits you'll do it using a **pull request**. Literally: you ask me to "pull in" your edits. I then have to check them and (hopefully) pull them in. [Here you can see how you have to send me a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).
