Quite a few people, mostly students of 1EA (Professional Bachelor Electronics ICT of the AP University College, academic year 2019-2020) have helped me with this course. Thanking them all separately would cost me an extra page, but I would like to expressly acknowledge the following people for their contribution: Ruben Simons, Ailko Claeys, Kevin Van Driel and Lennert Van Riel . Without them, this book would contain many more errors and would not have the structure it has now. If there are any mistakes in it, it is of course entirely my fault! A special thanks to Maarten Wachters who made the original pixel-art of me on which I made some variations!

Also a bunch of flowers to Olga Coutrin and Walter Van Hoof for taking on the thankless task of correcting my many grammatical-errors less than a week before the deadline. Thanks a lot!


If certain chapters or sections are not clear or contain errors, please do not hesitate to contact me. Normally, all text and images are mine, unless I say otherwise. Of course, I sometimes make mistakes, so if you discover an unattributed text or image, please let me know.

# External sources
This book is the result of almost a decade of teaching C# at the AP University College(first University College Antwerp, then Artesis University College, then Artesis Plantijn University College...). The first writings appeared on an own hosted blog ("Code of 1001 Nights", which is now defunct) and then it got a slightly tighter, unambiguous form as a gitbook course. This course, as well as a host of exercises and other useful extras, can be found at [timdams.com/ziescherp](https://timdams.com/ziescherp/). The content of the course is identical to that of this book. Of course, there is a chance that the online version will have fewer spelling mistakes by now.

Why this short history? Well, there is a chance that here and there in this book, fragments of text, code examples, or exercises are not originally mine. I have tried to indicate as much as possible what comes from where, but if I did forget something, don't hesitate to point it out to me. For the sake of completeness, here are some of the books, sites or other sources of "inspiration" that have been used over the years:

* Following books:
  * Microsoft Visual C# 2010 - An Introduction To Object-Oriented Programming by Joyce Farrell (ISBN: 9781111529758)
  * Programmeren in C# van Douglass Bell, Mike Parr en Kris Hermans (ISBN: 9789043036139)
* Exercises from the excellent website [c-sharp.be](https://www.c-sharp.be/) which I have no idea who maintains.
* Some of the exercises and components come from the "Programmeren" course taught by colleague Olga Coutrin from the Applied Computer Science course at AP University of Applied Sciences.
