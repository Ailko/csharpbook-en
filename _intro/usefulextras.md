# Books

Almost an infinite number of books have been written about C#, at least is seems that way. Here is a selection of books with a short 

Er zijn quasi oneindig veel boeken over C# geschreven, althans zo lijkt het. Here is a selection of books with a short discussion of why I think they can be of value to you when learning to program C#:

## Beginner books

* [C# Programming](https://ineasysteps.com/products-page/all_books/c-sharp-programming-in-easy-steps/) by Mike McGrath: an extremely compact, but very clear and colorful book that I strongly recommend if you have some trouble with the material of the first weeks.
* [Microsoft Visual C# 2015: An introduction to OOP](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Visual-2015-Introduction-Object-Oriented/dp/1285860233) by Joice Farrell: not the sexiest book, but the most complete in terms of overlap with the subject matter of this book. Recommended for those who want to go into more detail and are looking for an infinite number of potential exam questions ;)
* [Head First C#](https://www.bol.com/nl/f/head-first-c/37019965) by Andrew Stellman & Jennifer Greene: Don't let the somewhat bizarre, almost toddlerish look and feel of the Head First books put you off. Every book in this series is gold. The Head First books are the ideal way if you are looking for an alternative way to understand complex material. Be sure to check out the Head First Design Patterns and Head First Sql books in the series!

## Advanced books

* [C# Unleashed](https://www.bol.com/nl/f/c-5-0-unleashed/9200000009902560) by Bart De Smet: in my opinion, **the** reference for understanding C# to the bone. Written by a Belgian who works on C# at Microsoft in Redmond.
* [Code Complete](https://www.amazon.de/Code-Complete-Practical-Construction-Costruction/dp/0735619670) by Steve McConnell: a reference work on 'programming in general'. The book has long been the book to read if you, as a programmer, want to find out what 'correct programming' entails. If you can write on your CV that you know this book inside out, any IT company will hire you in a heartbeat ;)

# Online 

Learning to program by doing only the assignments in this book will not get you far (enough). However, our dear friend the Internet has many brilliant resources. Here is an overview.

## Cheat sheet

The following document contains an overview of the basic C# syntax issues of the first and (part of) the second semester:[download here](../assets/0_intro/cheat-sheet.pdf)

## Game-based programming

The ideal way to get to grips with programming in a playful way:

### Apps

* [SoloLearn](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sololearn): Mandatory app! Simple as that!
* [Enki](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enki.insights&hl=en) Just like SoloLearn, but different.
* [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/course/700046/learn-c/) (highly recommended!) Originally intended mainly for learning spoken languages, but also contains many other things. Mainly useful to 'drill' new aspects. So it is only useful if you have processed the basic material first.  Be sure to check out the many other courses on the site. Make sure you set the filter to English, there are not many (good) Dutch C# courses as far as I know. **Attention: you can only subscribe to non-speaking courses through the browser. The app only shows spoken language courses**.
* [Mimo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getmimo) Playful and rather limited in its free version, but an ideal supplement to SoloLearn.
* [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) A steam game to learn programming. It's JavaScript (useful for Web Programming) but the concept is too cool not to mention here and as you will discover, learning to program can be done in any language, and it will improve your other programming experience as well. Give it a go!

## Streaming programmers

Yes, they exist. More and more professional and novice programmers stream while programming. This is an ideal way to see how other people tackle problems. Most programming streamers can be found on Youtube, but also on Twitch there are more and more. We recommend a few (be sure to watch the videos from the archives):

* [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/): This programmer made a complete RPG and streamed the whole process.
* [CSharpFrits](http://youtube.com/csharpfritz)
* [DevChatter](https://www.twitch.tv/devchatter)
