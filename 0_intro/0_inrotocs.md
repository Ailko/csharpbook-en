# The first steps

Well, well, who do we have here?! Someone who wants to learn the noble art of programming? Then you've come to the right place. You may not believe it, but at the end of this chapter you will already be able to create your first very own computer applications. The road to eternal fame, glory, lots of cursing and reusing code is in front of you. Are you ready?

The first steps are never easy. We are gonna try to keep the amount of expensive words, weird abbreviations and complicated diagrams to a minimum. Still, if you want to learn a new art you will have to get your hands (and keyboard) dirty. No matter what happens in the coming chapters: keep persevering. Learning to program is a bit like learning to climb a mountain that you never seem to be able to reach the summit of. Which is also true. There is no "summit", and that is just the beauty of it all. There's always something new to learn! The things you will be cursing over in the coming pages will seem like child's play in a few chapters. So hang in there, keep practicing, feel free to curse every once in a while and most importantly: enjoy discovering new things!


## What is programming?

You regularly hear the terms: software developer, programmer, app-developer, etc. All of these are proffesions that can essentially be reduced to the same thing: programming. Programmers have learned how to give computers commands (**programming**) so that they will hopefully do what you ask them to do.

In the 21st century the term *computer* is quite broad. Almost every device that runs on electricity now contains a computer. Ranging from smart lights, to the servers that keep the internet running, to the smartwatch on your wrist. Even quite a few refrigerators and washing machines are beginning to contain (small) computers.

The big problem with computers, regardless of their size or power, is that they are essentially incredibly stupid things. They will always do **exactly** what you tell them to do. So if you instruct them to explode, don't be shocked that you have to call 911 a moment later.

**Programming involves learning to talk to those dumb computers so they do what you want them to do.**

### The algorithm

> First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.

This quote by John Johnson is sometimes frowned upon by many novice programmers. "I just want to write code!" It is a myth that programmers are constantly writing code. On the contrary, a good programmer will put much more time into the "preparation" for writing code: creating a good **algorithm**.

The algorithm is the essence of a computer program and can be thought of as the recipe that you are going to give to the computer so that it solves your problem correctly. The algorithm consists of a series of instructions that the computer must execute each time your program is executed.

The algorithm of a program is something you have to come up with yourself. However, the order in which the instructions are executed is very important. This is exactly the same as in real life: an algorithm to pump up your bicycle might be:

```text
Remove cap fom valve
Place pump on valve
Start pumping
```

Any other sequence of the above algorithm will give strange (and sometimes fatal) errors.

So if you want to learn programming, you will have to learn to think logically and have an analytical mind. If you kick a ball first before looking where the goal is then the noble art of programming will become a...special affair for you.

By the way, from now on you are authorized to email the news services every time they incorrectly use the word "logarithm" instead of "algorithm." The word logarithm is something that evokes nightmares from math classes for some and has absolutely nothing to do with programming. Of course, one day you may have to write an algorithm to calculate a logarithm. Hopefully, a journalist will never have to use the preceding sentence in a news report.
