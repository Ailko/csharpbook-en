# The first steps

Well, well, who do we have here?! Someone who wants to learn the noble art of programming? Then you've come to the right place. You may not believe it, but at the end of this chapter you will already be able to create your first very own computer applications. The road to eternal fame, glory, lots of cursing and reusing code is in front of you. Are you ready?

The first steps are never easy. We are gonna try to keep the amount of expensive words, weird abbreviations and complicated diagrams to a minimum. Still, if you want to learn a new art you will have to get your hands (and keyboard) dirty. No matter what happens in the coming chapters: keep persevering. Learning to program is a bit like learning to climb a mountain that you never seem to be able to reach the summit of. Which is also true. There is no "summit", and that is just the beauty of it all. There's always something new to learn! The things you will be cursing over in the coming pages will seem like child's play in a few chapters. So hang in there, keep practicing, feel free to curse every once in a while and most importantly: enjoy discovering new things!


# What is programming?

You regularly hear the terms: software developer, programmer, app-developer, etc. All of these are proffesions that can essentially be reduced to the same thing: programming. Programmers have learned how to give computers commands (**programming**) so that they will hopefully do what you ask them to do.

{% hint style='tip' %}
In the 21st century the term *computer* is quite broad. Almost every device that runs on electricity now contains a computer. Ranging from smart lights, to the servers that keep the internet running, to the smartwatch on your wrist. Even quite a few refrigerators and washing machines are beginning to contain (small) computers.

The big problem with computers, regardless of their size or power, is that they are essentially incredibly stupid things. They will always do **exactly** what you tell them to do. So if you instruct them to explode, don't be shocked that you have to call 911 a moment later.

**Programming involves learning to talk to those dumb computers so they do what you want them to do.**
