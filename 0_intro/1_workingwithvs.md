## Introduction to C# and Visual Studio

In this book we are going to learn how to program with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, a software package for which there is also a free community version. Microsoft Visual Studio (from now on **VS**) is a package that brings together many of the tools a programmer needs (debugger, code editor, compiler, etc).

VS is a so-called IDE ("Integrated Development Environment") and is tailored to develop applications written in C#. However, you are far from required to develop only C# applications in VS, you can feel free to use VB.NET, TypeScript, Python and other languages. Also vice versa, you are not required to use VS to develop. You can even write code in notepad and then compile it (see below). There are even online C# programming environments, such as [dotnetfiddle.net](https://dotnetfiddle.net/).

In this book, we will always work with Visual Studio. Not with Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a lightweight version of VS that certainly has its advantages (easily extensible, fast, compact, etc). Thanks to VS Code, Visual Studio is finally finding its way onto other platforms than just Microsoft. If you are looking for a lightweight version then you should definitely try [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
