SO, you've decided to learn the noble language known as C#? You've come to the right place. This book is used as handbook within the proffesional bachelor Electronics-ICT and Applied Informatics at AP University College. Through many years it has grown to a two part series (1 per semester) of which you're currently holding the first. In this part you will discover the basics of C# and programming in general.

This book will lay the foundation and handle things like variables, loops, methods and arrays. The second book continues with this and will (hopefully) uncover the mystical, but oh so important, world of Object oriented programming.

You may be wondering how up-to-date this book is? Well, it released in 2020, so... (mmm, using the year 2020 as quality label is kindof like saying you make wine using sewage). Nevertheless, the book is brand new and, so far, has survived the year 2020.

Just like our spoken languages, the C# programming language is continually evolving (while I'm writing this we're on version 8.0). With every new C#-version certain code-constructions suddenly get a lot simpler or even redundant. A good programmer must, of course, be able to work with both the old and the new constructions. I have attempted to find a healthy mix between old and new, with a focus on the usability in your further proffesional career. Therefor, you will not find any cool, state-of-the-art C# innovations that are only usable in very specific projects. On the contrary, I hope that when you have gone through this volume and the next that you will dare to dive into 'sister languages' (like Java, C and C++, but even distant relatives like Python or Javascript) without any problems.

This book doesn't aspire to teach all of the C#-language and everything surrounding it, this book is way too short for that. This is aimed at anyone who is interested in the wonderful world of programming, but possibly hasn't ever actually programmed a single letter of code. Certain concepts that I consider too complicated for a novice programmer were therefor left out of this course. Consider this book as a gatewaydrug to more C#, more programming languages and especially more (programming)fun! You have been warned.

Happy reading and programming fun,
