# And now? Do I know everything about C#/.NET now

Unfortunately not. But you have laid a very good foundation now. From this point forward you can go in numerous directions, depending on your interests:
* **Advanced C# concepts**: You could delve into "the laguage C#". Just think of learning to work with **``async``** and **events**. But there's also the wonderful **Linq**, which can be used in almost all .NET sections.
* **Desktop applications**: So far we've only made boring console applications. Of course it's also very simple to use your current knowledge to make so called desktop applications. Certainly take a look at what **WPF** and **UWP** have to offer. You'll have to settle into working with **event based** programming and **XAML** and from then on you'll be well on your way!
* **Mobile applications**: TODO (Xamarin)
* **Web develoment**: Ook .NET has a so-called back-end stack which is used by a good number of large companies. This technology-stack contains a number of important technologies like **ASP.NET** and **Entity Framework**. And if you've had enouhj of always having to work in Javascript, then you should certainly take a look at the youngest of the family, **Blazor**, which allows you to write C# inside your HTML!
* **Azure and the cloud**: And if you want to really discover how little you know of .NET, take a look at all the things that can be found under the **Azure** branch of Microsoft. Azure is the collective name for all the cloud-based technologies & services of Microsoft, where .NET is a very important part of it.
